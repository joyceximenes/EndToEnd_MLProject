# End to end Machine Learning project
This project is based on second chapter of "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow" book,  which shows a full cycle of Machine Learning development. 

The main steps:
  - Get the Data
  - Explore and Visualize the Data to Gain Insights
  - Prepare the Data for Machine Learning Algorithms
  - Select and Train a Model
  - Fine-Tune the Model
  - Launch, Monitor, and Maintain the System
